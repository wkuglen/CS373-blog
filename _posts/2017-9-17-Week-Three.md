### What did you do this past week?
This week in class we talked about Python in more detail, specifically exceptions, types, objects, and basic data structures. The first project, Collatz, was due this week. I underestimated the amount of time the project would take, so I ended up procrastinating and rushing to finish the project in the end. Outside of class, the career fair was this week, which I think went quite well.

### What's in your way?
The main obstacles in my way right now are unrelated to this class. I have fallen behind in some of my classes, so I am currently trying to catch back up.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, for this class, I would like to meet up with my group and hopefully start the next project. In my other classes, I have group projects that I also need to find time for and work on. Over the course of this week, I would also like to follow up with the companies I talked to at the career fair, especially the ones that looked like a good fit for me.

### What's my experience of the class?
So far I have been content with the material and lectures in this class. However, I will say that I have not been convinced to switch over to Python. I think Python has too many oddities that I don’t understand the reasoning behind. For example, Python does not have a stack structure, but it does have other structures like a deque. I also think that the way Python handles variables (and their types) makes it harder to debug.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Since we are starting group projects and the reading for this week is about pair programming, my pick-of-the-week is another form of the social/communal approach to programming: the informal peer review of your code. [This article](https://blog.codinghorror.com/whos-your-coding-buddy/) by Jeff Atwood briefly explains the concept and benefits of peer reviews. Of course this should only be used when you are not required to use pair programming or when it does not violate academic integrity (a side project would be a great place to use this technique). While it may not be as applicable while in school, I think asking someone to look over your code can help you write better code overall.

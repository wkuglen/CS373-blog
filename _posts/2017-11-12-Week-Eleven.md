### What did you do this past week?
In class this week, we talked more about SQL and we talked about strategies for refactoring. On Thursday, the third phase of the database project was due. I think we did better at getting things done but we still didn’t finish in time.

### What's in your way?
Since we didn’t finish the third phase, we need to finish the third phase so we can start the fourth phase. The two things we didn’t have were search and filtering. Luckily, the backend is setup and working for both of those. The frontend, however, is not complete for either.

### What will you do next week?
Personally, my biggest event next week is the Design Career Jam (a career fair) on Thursday. This event is a bit different than a traditional career fair because the companies come around to different groups of students and talk for about fifteen minutes, so it will be interesting to see how it goes. For this class, my group and I are going to finish everything leftover from the third phase and start the last phase this week.

### What's my experience of the class?
As far as I can tell, we have been doing a lot of different topics in the past few weeks. While it is great to learn a bunch of different stuff, I am a bit concerned about how the second exam will look.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
On Friday, I was talking to a friend about JavaScript and they suggested the IntelliJ and WebStorm IDEs. IntelliJ was my main Java IDE a long time ago. Since moving to C/C++, I have mainly used Sublime, even for things like JavaScript. Now that I am writing more code that isn’t C/C++, I am revisiting these programs and I would definitely recommend them to anyone. The best part is that when you are a student or instructor, you can get them for FREE [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/)!

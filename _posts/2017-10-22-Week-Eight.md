### What did you do this past week?
This week in class we talked about relational databases and some basic operations on them. My group started really focus on the project this week and we have made significant progress. There was also a tech talk with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday evening. Outside of class, I had my onsite technical interview at Spiceworks on Monday and I did an online coding challenge for Google later in the week.

### What's in your way?
My main concern right now is the third project (the second phase of the database project). Last time we were scrambling to get everything finished in the end. This time, I would really like to finish the project early and I think my team is more aware of what is going on and what is required.

### What will you do next week?
Like I said above, my team and I need to finish the third project. I have other things do in other classes, but my main focus is on this class and this third project.

### What's my experience of the class?
The Goldman Sachs talk on Wednesday could not have come at a better time and was the highlight of class for me this week. While the talk was focused on a full product, I found the frontend portion really helpful because the engineer discussed React and Redux. I finally understood React on Wednesday afternoon and the talk and my conversation with the frontend engineer afterwards solidified my understanding.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [Redux](http://redux.js.org), which I learned about from the tech talk. Basically, Redux performs state changes through reducers. Reducers take the current state and the action and produce the changed state (as a new object). I havenâ€™t had the opportunity to use Redux yet, but I hope to implement it into later stages of the database project.

### What did you do this past week?
In class on Wednesday, we took a demo of the exam on HackerRank, which I thought was beneficial. On Thursday, we had our midterm, which was composed of half multiple-choice questions on Canvas and half coding questions on HackerRank.

### What's in your way?
The main thing in my way this week is the third project. My team has made progress on both the frontend and the backend but we still have a lot of the project left to do.

### What will you do next week?
Since the project is due in less than two weeks, my team and I will be working on the project for the majority of the time. Outside of class, I have an onsite technical interview with Spiceworks on Monday.

### What's my experience of the class?
Since we had the exam this week, I would like to share my thoughts about it rather than speak about my overall experience with the class. On a personal note, I had a lot of other assignments and exams on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, so I did not get to study as much as I would have liked. I also got sick Wednesday night, so I was not feeling great for the exam on Thursday night. Overall, I thought the exam was fair and was not too easy or too hard. I got stuck on one of the HackerRank questions and there were a few multiple-choice questions I was not sure about.  One thing (problem?) I realized was that you could check the multiple-choice coding questions on HackerRank, which sort of defeats the purpose of the question. I didnâ€™t actually try to do this but I thought it was an interesting loophole. Besides that problem, I liked the ability to answer the coding questions on HackerRank because it was easier than a text box to use and because it allowed me to debug and test the code I wrote.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this article](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) about code reviews and how to improve the reviewing process for the author and reviewer.

### What did you do this past week?
In class this past week, we discussed the second project and how it would develop into the third, fourth, and fifth projects. We also talked about operators and variables. Outside of class, my group met several times this week to work on the project.

### What's in your way?
If you had asked me earlier today, I would say that understanding and getting React.js to work has been my biggest challenge. Now that I know React.js is not required for the first project, I can relax a little and work with my group on the rest of the project. I think our biggest obstacle, at least in my opinion, will be the technical report. For me, the upcoming week has a lot of deadlines, so I will need to organize my time well in order to not be so overwhelmed.

### What will you do next week?
For this class, the second project is due on Thursday. I know my group would like to get the website done by the end of Tuesday. We would then write the technical report on Wednesday and Thursday. Personally, I have an essay due Wednesday and a final presentation (for a 5-week class) due Thursday. I also have class from 8am to 9pm on Thursday, so meeting with my group to finish and submit the project will be difficult.

### What's my experience of the class?
As I mentioned above, I did not realize that the second project did not require React.js, so I wish it were a bit clearer (or at least I had read a bit more carefully) what was required for the second project and what the requirements for the entire project were.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
Last week I went to the MAD Advanced Web Development Workshop. If you are like me and have just started to learn JavaScript or React.js, I would recommend going. The workshops are every other Wednesday in GDC 1.304 from 5pm to 6pm.

### What are your expectations of the class?
Having taken Professor Downing’s CS 371p Object-Oriented Programming class, I expect this class to be similar in structure. However, I am still anxious about the material in the class because I have never worked with web development (beyond HTML and CSS).

### What did you do this past week?
Although this week was syllabus week, I was actually quite busy. On Monday I had to attend an orientation session because I added a second major. Once classes started, I did not have much class work but I did have a lot of paperwork I had to fill out for my other major. In this class, we started to cover Python and the Collatz Conjecture on Friday.

### What's in your way?
The biggest thing in my way this week (and probably the rest of the semester) is the amount of new things in my life. This year is my first year living off campus in an apartment. I also added a new major, Design, so I am now a Computer Science and Design student and I am faced with balancing my time between the two. On top of all of that, I am also taking more credit hours than I have before, two of which are writing flags. Despite all of these new changes, I am really excited for the semester.

### What will you do next week?
Next week I expect my classes to start covering material and assigning work. For this class, I expect to start the first project, Collatz. Outside of class, I plan on applying for internships, especially since the career fair is in less than two weeks.

### What's my experience of the class?
Since the semester just started, I don’t have much to base my experience on. However, the first two days felt fairly similar OOP (you can read about my experiences [here](https://wkuglen.github.io/CS371p-blog/])) in terms of the course structure and pace.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
This summer I tried to build a terminal-based text editor (and I am still working on it). When thinking about the future of the project I thought about the problem of ASCII vs. Unicode and I came across [this article](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) by Joel Spolsky. I definitely recommend this article for anyone that works with text. Spolsky also has a lot of other interesting articles about software development (some of which we read in OOP).

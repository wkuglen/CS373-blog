Overall, I learned a lot in SWE and I am glad I took it. I had no prior experience with any of the material in the class or in the projects. I think the most valuable thing I got out of this class was how to work with other people in a software development context. I have used Git for years but I learned how little I knew when it came to working on the same branches and in the same repositories as other people. I also learned the importance of dividing work instead of doing work as a group (which is what I did in Operating Systems).

For students that are contemplating taking this class, let me provide you with my background so you can compare. I did not know Python, SQL, or modern web development (JavaScript). I also took Object Oriented Programming last spring with Professor Downing. For me, this class was harder and had a greater workload than I expected. I was expecting something similar in difficulty (of material) but more work intensive than OOP. In reality, I would say the workload for SWE was definitely more than OOP or courses like Data Structures but not quite the same workload as OS. I will say that SWE is similar to OS in that there is one central project that you continue to build off of. The material was not terribly difficult but there were a lot of different subjects, which complicates everything. The quiz and test questions are typically detail-oriented, which made them difficult for me (they are similar in style to the questions in OOP). Overall, the projects in this class seemed closest to the kinds of problems you would solve in industry.

I would definitely recommend SWE as an upper-division CS elective. You can go into the class knowing nothing, like I did, and still do well but it would be to your advantage to have prior experience with either Python, SQL, or JavaScript (ReactJS).

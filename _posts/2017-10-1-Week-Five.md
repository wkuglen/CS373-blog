### What did you do this past week?
This past week we finished the second project, which was due on Thursday. I was under a lot of stress this past week, so I ended up missing class on Wednesday. In addition to all of the essays and projects that were due this week, I also had my first technical interview (as in first ever technical interview) with Apple, which is at the top of my list. During the interview and immediately after, I was not confident in my performance and it made me question my skills in CS. However, I talked to some of my friends about the interview and it seems I did not do as bad as I had thought.

### What's in your way?
I haven’t been doing too well on the quizzes (and I have missed a few), so my goal for this week is to prepare more for the quizzes.

### What will you do next week?
This upcoming week, my group is going to start the third project. I also have another technical interview, this time with ExxonMobil.

### What's my experience of the class?
Of the classes I did go to this week, everything went as well as I expected. Even after the project was clarified, I definitely underestimated the amount of work I needed to do for the second project. My group turned the project in on time, but we want to start the project early so that there is not as much stuff to do at the end.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I have mentioned before that I was working on building a terminal-based text editor. Originally I had planned to do as much as I could without looking anything up, including underlying data structures. Today I came across [this article](http://www.averylaird.com/programming/editor/2017/09/30/the-piece-table/) that discusses the data structures of text editors and I couldn’t resist looking at it. As it turns out, I came up with something similar to the gap buffer and I had thought about a structure similar to the piece table.

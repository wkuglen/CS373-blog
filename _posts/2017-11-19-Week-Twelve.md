### What did you do this past week?
In class on Monday, we continued refactoring. On Wednesday, we had a guest lecture from Alan Cline and Elaine Rich about ethics in software engineering. I really enjoyed it and I think ethics is an important topic since we are encountering software in society more and more. Unfortunately, I missed class on Friday.

### What's in your way?
Most of the things immediately in my way are for different classes. For this class, finishing the final project is my main concern. After this upcoming Tuesday, I hope my group and I can finish it up before the due date.

### What will you do next week?
Next week, I have an essay due Monday, a poster due Tuesday morning and a presentation Tuesday evening. The rest of the week is off, but I already know that I am going to need to work a lot over the Thanksgiving break.

### What's my experience of the class?
I know others have voiced their opinions about this in the past but I would like to give my opinion of the Google Cloud Platform. Basically GCP is an expensive and difficult service (at least for the project in this class). We haven’t run out of credits yet (since we can claim two) but the first time I tried to claim a $50 credit, the code was invalid (I don’t think this is going to be a problem before the end of the semester). I was not in charge of setting GCP up but my teammates have said it was hard to work with and took a long time to actually deploy. To my understanding, GCP does not support Python 3 so we have had to use Flex to make our project work, which is computationally expensive in GCP and burns through money quickly. I think almost every phase has shut down due to a lack of credits before grading was finished. Unless GCP changes significantly, I do not think GCP should be used as the platform for hosting these projects in future semesters.

### What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
My pick-of-the-week is [this article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/microsoft-and-github-team-up-to-take-git-virtual-file-system-to-macos-linux/) on the Git Virtual File System (GVFS). The basic idea is for GVFS to let Git scale to large repositories. I never really considered the scalability of Git and I think it is interesting that the proposed solution is a new file system and not a new version control system.
